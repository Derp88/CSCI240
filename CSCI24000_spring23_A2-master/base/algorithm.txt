Goals: Sort an array of numbers using a bubble sort algorithim
Inputs: An array of numbers (unsorted)
Output: An array of numbers that has been sorted.
Steps:
	- Print the initial array of values
	- Sort the values
		- For every value in the array minus 1 (outer loop)
			-  For evey value in the array minus 1 (inner loop)
			-  If the first item in the array is bigger than the next item in the array
				- Swap the items so the bigger one is in the second spot.
					- We will use pointers here and store copys of the values in a function, so we can swap.
			- NOTE (Basically the inner loop does the sorting)
			The outer loop keeps it running until it is actually sorted
	- Print the new sorted values
